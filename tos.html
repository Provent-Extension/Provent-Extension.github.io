					<h2 class="info_title tos_character_casing" id="policy1">1. Agreement To Terms</h2>
					<p class="info_des">These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and Provent, concerning your access to and use of the chrome extension and website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Chrome Extension”). You agree that by using the Chrome Extension, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Service. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE CHROME EXTENSION AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

						Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Chrome Extension from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Service. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Service, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Chrome Extension so that you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Service by your continued use of the Chrome Extension after the date such revised Terms of Service are posted.
						
						The information provided on the Chrome Extension is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Chrome Extension from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
						
						The Chrome Extension is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Chrome Extension. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms of Service.
